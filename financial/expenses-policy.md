# Expenses Policy

London Hackspace members are allowed to claim expenses for money spent
on behalf of the organisation, subject to these rules:

1. Expenses must be submitted for reimbursement no later than 6 months
   after they are incurred.
2. All expense claims must be accompanied by a copy of the receipt or
   invoice.
3. Expense claims for less than £50 do not need prior authorisation as
   long as they are clearly for the benefit of the Hackspace. If there
   is any doubt, they should be authorised by any Trustee.
4. Expense claims in excess of £50 must be authorised in advance by a
   Trustee unless they are covered by a pre-agreed budget.
5. Expenditures in excess of £250 will not be accepted as expenses
   claims. Items above this limit should be purchased directly by the
   organisation with approval of the Treasurer. In exceptional
   circumstances, the Trustees may elect to vary this rule.
