# Expenses Policy

London Hackspace members are allowed to claim expenses for money spent
on behalf of the organisation, subject to these rules:

1. Expenses must be submitted for reimbursement no later than 6 months
   after they are incurred.
2. All expense claims must be accompanied by a copy of the receipt or
   invoice.
3. Expense claims for less than £50 do not need prior authorisation as
   long as they are clearly for items for the benefit of the Hackspace.
4. Expense claims in excess of £50 must be authorised in advance by a
   Trustee.
5. Expenditures in excess of £250 will not be accepted as expenses
   claims. Items above this limit should be purchased directly by the
   organisation. The Trustees may make exceptions to this rule in
   exceptional circumstances.
