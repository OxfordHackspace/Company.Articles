# Reserves Policy

Article 4(f) of the London Hackspace Articles of Association gives the
association the power "to set aside income as a reserve against future
expenditure but only in accordance with a written policy about reserves."

This policy ensures the financial stability of London Hackspace's
operations.

## Reserves
### Operating Reserve

The Operating Reserve is intended to provide an internal source of funds
for situations such as a sudden increase in expenses, one-time unbudgeted
expenses, unanticipated loss in funding, or uninsured losses. Operating
Reserves are not intended to replace a permanent loss of funds or eliminate
an ongoing budget gap.

The target minimum Operating Reserve should be equal to three months of
average operating expenses. Depreciation, in-kind, and other non-cash
expenses are not included in the calculation.

### Buildings Reserve

The Buildings Reserve is intended to provide for additional costs incurred
when London Hackspace moves premises. The organisation should set aside a
sufficient reserve to cover the costs of making good previous premises,
removals, and fitting out new premises.

The size of the Buildings Reserve will be determined by the Trustees based
on the time remaining on the current lease, and the projected costs of
moving premises.

## Funding of Reserves

The Reserves will be funded with surplus unrestricted operating funds.

## Use of Reserves

The Treasurer and other members of the Board of Trustees will identify the
need for access to reserve funds and confirm that the use is consistent with
the purpose of the reserves as described in this Policy. This step requires
analysis of the reason for the shortfall, the availability of any other
sources of funds before using reserves, and evaluation of the time period
that the funds will be required and replenished.

Any use of the Reserves must be approved by a vote of the Trustees.
